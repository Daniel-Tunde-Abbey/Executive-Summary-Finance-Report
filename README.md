# Executive Finance Report 2013-2014 Dashboard 


## Overview 
The **Executive Finance Report 2013-2014 Dashboard** is a **financial analysis tool** designed to provide business leaders and financial analysts with a **clear, data-driven understanding of company profitability, sales trends, and cost efficiency**. The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as **total profit, discounts applied, total units sold, total sales, and cost of goods sold (COGS)**. It also presents a **regional breakdown of profit distribution** and an analysis of **product performance across different market segments**.  

This project aims to **simplify complex financial data**, helping businesses **track revenue growth, monitor key financial indicators, and optimize sales strategies** based on real-time insights.  


## Problem Statement  
In many organizations, financial data is often **scattered, overwhelming, and difficult to interpret**. Executives struggle to identify:  
- **Which regions contribute the most profit** and how market segments influence revenue generation.  
- **How discounts impact overall financial performance** and whether they boost sales or hurt profitability.  
- **Which products perform best across different sales segments** (such as small businesses, midmarket, government, and enterprise customers).  
- **How sales trends fluctuate over time** and their correlation with external factors.  

Without an interactive, well-structured financial dashboard, decision-makers rely on **manual reports, spreadsheets, and fragmented insights**, leading to **delayed actions and inefficient financial strategies**.  

This project **solves that challenge** by providing an **interactive, visually appealing dashboard** that delivers **clear, actionable insights into financial performance**.  


## Objectives 
The **Executive Finance Report Dashboard** was built to:  
1. **Track financial performance over time**, highlighting trends in **total profit, sales, and cost of goods sold (COGS)**.  
2. **Analyze the impact of discounts** on revenue and profitability, helping businesses determine the optimal discounting strategy.  
3. **Understand regional profit distribution**, identifying which countries contribute the most revenue.  
4. **Evaluate product performance** by market segment, providing insights into which segments drive the highest sales.  
5. **Enhance data-driven decision-making** by presenting financial data in an easy-to-understand, interactive format.  



## Data Methods 
### **1. Data Cleaning & Processing**  
Before visualization, the raw sales and finance data were **cleaned and processed in Microsoft Excel** using the following techniques:  
- **Removed duplicates and inconsistent records** to improve data accuracy.  
- **Formatted financial figures, dates, and categorical values** for consistency.  
- **Created calculated columns** for key financial metrics such as total profit, discount impact, and cost of goods sold (COGS).  
- **Filtered out missing or irrelevant data** to ensure meaningful insights.  

### **2. Data Analysis & Visualization**  
The cleaned dataset was imported into **Power BI** to create the dashboard. The following visualization techniques were used:  
- **KPI Cards** to summarize **Total Profit, Total Discounts Applied, Total Units Sold, Total Sales, and Total COGS**.  
- **Line Chart** to show **profit trends over time (2013-2014)**.  
- **Donut Chart** to visualize **profit distribution by country**, highlighting **France, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the USA**.  
- **Bar Chart** to compare **total sales by product and customer segment** (Channel Partners, Enterprise, Government, Midmarket, and Small Business).  
- **Interactive Filters & Slicers** to allow users to **explore specific months, years, and sales segments** dynamically.  


## Data Source  
The dataset consists of financial records covering the years **2013-2014**, containing the following key fields:  
- **Total Profit** â€“ The net profit generated after deducting costs.  
- **Total Discounts Applied** â€“ The total amount of discounts given across all sales.  
- **Total Units Sold** â€“ The number of products sold within the reporting period.  
- **Total Sales** â€“ The total revenue generated before deducting costs.  
- **Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** â€“ The total cost of production and procurement.  
- **Profit by Country** â€“ Financial performance breakdown by region (France, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the USA).  
- **Total Sales by Product and Segment** â€“ Sales analysis by **product type and customer segment** (Channel Partners, Enterprise, Government, Midmarket, and Small Business).  


## Key Insights  
The dashboard provided several key insights into **financial and sales performance**:  
1. **Profit Trends:**  
   - Profit fluctuated over the **two-year period (2013-2014)**, with noticeable **spikes in early 2014 and a peak towards the end of the year**.  
   - This suggests possible **seasonal trends, promotional events, or external economic factors** influencing sales.  

2. **Regional Profit Contribution:**  
   - The **United States generated the highest share of total profit (22.46%)**, followed by **Germany (21.7%) and Mexico (21.12%)**.  
   - Canada and France contributed **17.39% and 17.33%**, respectively, indicating **relatively balanced regional performance**.  

3. **Impact of Discounts:**  
   - The company applied **$8.05M in discounts**, raising concerns about their impact on overall profitability.  
   - While discounts **boosted total units sold**, they **may have reduced net revenue in some regions**.  

4. **Sales by Product and Segment:**  
   - The **top-selling products** included **Paseo, VTT, and Amarilla**, with Paseo leading in revenue.  
   - **Small businesses and midmarket customers** generated significant sales, while **government and enterprise segments contributed smaller volumes**.  
   - **Channel partners played a key role in driving revenue**, especially for **high-value products like VTT and Amarilla**.  



## Recommendations 
Based on these insights, the following recommendations were made:  
1. The company should **reassess its discounting approach**, ensuring that discounts drive **sustainable revenue growth without significantly cutting into profits**. Targeted discounts should be **limited to high-margin products** to maintain profitability.  

2. Since the **United States, Germany, and Mexico** generated the highest profits, the company should **strengthen its presence in these regions** through **targeted marketing campaigns and regional expansion strategies**.  

3. The company should consider **expanding successful product lines like Paseo and VTT** while reassessing **low-performing products**. Further market research is needed to understand **why certain products perform better across different segments**.  

4. **Channel partners significantly contribute to sales**, so the company should consider **offering exclusive incentives, better commission structures, or training programs** to maximize performance.  

5. Since sales **peaked in early and late 2014**, the company should **plan ahead for seasonal trends** by **adjusting inventory, launching promotions at the right time, and preparing marketing strategies in advance**.
